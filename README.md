# Atlas_V_Rocket_simulation
This project simulated the launch of an Atlas V Rocket through the atmosphere and into space. The design features were extracted from the Atlas V user guide (easily accessible online).
The project was completed in a team of 3 as part of an Electrical Engineering coursework in 2018. This was during my second year of undergraduate General Engineering studies.
